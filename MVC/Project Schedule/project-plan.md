# Aniâ€™s Pulse Project Plan
## Overview
A PDE-based project management simulation tool with dynamic Gantt charts and heatmaps for project managers and researchers, built with Python/Streamlit.

## Milestones
- Oct 2025: Complete PDE solver and basic Gantt chart.
- Dec 2025: MVP with heatmap and 3D PDE plot.
- Feb 2026: Beta testing with user feedback.

## Tasks
- Set up Streamlit/MVC (`app.py`, `model.py`, `view.py`, `controller.py`): 20 hours (Done)
- Code PDE solver for task dependencies (`model.py`): 20 hours
- Build dynamic Gantt chart (`view.py`, Plotly): 15 hours
- Create 2D heatmap for completion % (`view.py`): 10 hours
- Develop 3D PDE plot (`view.py`): 15 hours
- Test and debug: 20 hours
- Write documentation (`README.md`): 5 hours

## Timeline
- Oct-Nov 2025: 80-160 hours (20 hours/week).
- LLC formation: Q1 2026.
- Beta launch: Q2 2026.
